    "description": "These boards are slabbed from enormous oak trees that have fallen down over the years, the ages range from 160-300 year old. They are slabbed, planed, sanded, and holes are drilled. The three pairs of pegs are crafted from ¼ inch diameter rods of brass, stainless steel and mild steel (Mild Steel painted black for better differentiation from stainless steel and corrosion resistance). The pegs are then milled with ridges for appearance and grip. Underneath the board is a hollowed space for peg storage with a copper plate attached to a brass hinge for easy accessibility. Each board is meticulously crafted and inscriptions are customized for each customer. Hand engraved titles and messages are encouraged!",

We saw an opportunity to create a unique piece by filling in the damaged areas with layer after layer of epoxy. The wood and epoxy now seamlessly integrate to form a single piece.

This table is also a blend of oak and epoxy, however, we decided to go a different route with the legs. The table is held in place by 3/8 inch flat bar steel bent to shape with an oxyacetylene torch. These custom-made legs make the table extremely rugged and durable.",
